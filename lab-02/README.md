### Implement the feedforward and backpropagation learning algorithm for multiple perceptrons in Python for the question provided in the attached image.
- Initialize the weights and biases randomly.
- Implement the forward pass.
- Compute the loss between the predicted output and the actual output using an appropriate loss function.
- Compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases using the chain rule.
- Update the weights and biases.
- Iterate over multiple times (epochs), performing forward propagation, loss calculation, backpropagation, and parameter updates in each iteration till convergence.
